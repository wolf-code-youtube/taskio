            <div className='text-md   pl-36 pr-36'>
                Taskio is a Task Management and Team Productivity tracking application built within the Shopify Admin. 
                It provides you with a minimalistic and user-friendly interface to help the team members catch-up with the tasks and goals
                happening throughout your organisation. It provides very well detailed view of each task or goal including properties
                like Task Deadline, Task Assignee, Label, ID, created At, etc.Each task can be viewed in the table on the home page, 
                but users need to use the slider to view all the properties for a 
                particular task.

                Title
            </div>
            <div className='text-md   pl-36 pr-36'>
                The first column "Title" is frozen in its place to provide a better interface. This should ideally be a short
                word or group of words for the task or goal.

                Priority
            </div>
            <div className='text-md   pl-36 pr-36'>
                Priority depicts the importance or the urgency of the task. It can have three values: low, medium or high. 
                Each value has a color in its background for a better User Experience.

            <div className='text-md   pl-36 pr-36'>
                Each task can have a description to add more about the details of the task.
                Note : Description has the word range of 1 to 100 words. So, while creating a task, this must be kept in mind.

            <div className='text-md   pl-36 pr-36'>
                Each task is created with a Deadline to keep better track of the progress. We intend to add mutliple features like filtering 
                using Deadline dates in the future.

                Users can add a label to each task in order to categorise them. A search bar is provided to search for tasks under a common label.
                Some examples for labels are : Shipping, Subscription, Inventory, Marketing, etc.

                This shows who assigned the task and to whom. While creating a task, the assigner has the choice to type the input, this is done
                to give the choice to make the assigner anonymous, or writing a team name as the assigner.
                Assigned To is a member from the team fetched from the users database. You can read more about users here.
